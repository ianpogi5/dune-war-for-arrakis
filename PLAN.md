# Dune: War for Arrakis — Solo Companion — PLAN

A web app (React + TypeScript) that runs the **Mahdi solo-mode Harkonnen "AI"** so the
solo player (playing Atreides) doesn't have to execute the Harkonnen priority rules by hand.

> **New session? Start here:** read this file, then `BOARD_VERIFICATION.md` (board data),
> then the memory index. Pick up at the first unchecked item under "Current status".

---

## 1. Problem & approach

- Solo play = player runs **Atreides**; the **Harkonnen are a deterministic AI** (rulebook
  p37 / fan-summary p9 in `docs/`). The friction is executing its nested priority lists every turn.
- The app is a **co-processor over the physical board**: it holds enough board state to apply
  the AI rules, tells the player exactly what the Harkonnen do, and the player executes it on
  the real board and confirms. The physical board stays the source of truth.

## 2. Architecture decisions (locked)

- **Stack:** React + TypeScript (local-first, no backend; AI logic runs client-side).
- **Scope first target:** base game **Mahdi solo only**. Expansions later (Smugglers,
  Spacing Guild [note: incompatible with Mahdi solo], Possible Futures).
- **Engine is headless & pure-TS**, decoupled from the UI, so it can be unit-tested against
  the rulebook's priority lists before any UI exists.
- **Mobile** (Capacitor/React Native wrapper) is a future goal, not now.

## 3. Build phases

### Phase 0 — Board data  *(✅ COMPLETE 2026-06-27 — all of §1–§5 done & user-verified)*
> **Resume here (next session): Phase 1 — generate `board.ts`** from `BOARD_VERIFICATION.md` §3a (adjacency),
> §4 (impassable), §5 (air zones), plus §1/§2 (areas, types, sectors, settlements/sietches). Delete §3b
> (old unreliable draft) when porting. A well-formedness test already passed via `scripts/gen_map.py`
> (symmetric edges, no isolated nodes, every id resolves). See also `BOARD_GRAPH.md` for the visual map.
Living file: `BOARD_VERIFICATION.md`. Extracted from physical-board photos in `docs/images/`.
- [x] Area names + types (colour rule: orange=plateau, grey=mountain, sand=desert, + minor_erg)
- [x] Settlements (Arrakeen III, Carthag II, 4 Pyon villages I: Arsunt, Hagga Basin, Imperial Basin, North Pole)
- [x] All 8 sietches named
- [x] `deep` (deep-desert) flag per named desert (deep = Sihaya Ridge, Rock Outcroppings, The Great Flat)
- [x] §2 Sectors (s1–s8 = 4 outer + 4 inner) — every area assigned; **board has 101 areas** (not ~50: plateau/mountain have many unnamed areas too)
- [x] §2.1/§2.2 all 101 areas have ids + positions (user physically numbered the board `s#_N`; read off the marked `docs/images/*.jpg` tiles)
- [x] **§3 Adjacency — ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-27).** All 8 sectors + North Pole (**101 areas**) traced and
      **user-verified area-by-area**: the user read each area's neighbour list and confirmed/corrected it; every
      list in `BOARD_VERIFICATION.md` §3a is ✅, cross-sector edges mirrored both ways, one commit per area.
      Method that worked: seed each area from the marked photos + prior cross-sector mirrors → present list →
      user corrects → record + commit. (Earlier batched-question rounds got cities/North Pole/outer ring; the
      area-by-area pass then verified/repaired everything.) §3b is the OLD unreliable draft — delete in Phase 1.
- [x] §4 Impassable borders — **DONE & user-verified exhaustive (2026-06-27): 11 red pairs** in `BOARD_VERIFICATION.md` §4 (one continuous arc on the N+W face of the central mass).
- [x] §5 Air zones — **DONE & user-confirmed (2026-06-27): 8 zones** in `BOARD_VERIFICATION.md` §5 (4 inner-ring links + 4 outer→inner spokes; each connects a specific 2–3 areas, not whole sectors/pole).

### Phase 1 — `board.ts`  *(✅ DONE 2026-06-27)*
- [x] Generated typed board module `src/engine/board.ts` from `BOARD_VERIFICATION.md` via
      `scripts/gen_board.py` (`npm run gen:board`): 101 `AREAS` (id/name/sector/terrain/deep/
      settlement/sietch), symmetric `ADJACENCY` (265 edges), `IMPASSABLE` (11), `AIR_ZONES` (8).
      ✅ **Terrain complete (2026-06-27):** all 101 areas typed via §6 of `BOARD_VERIFICATION.md`
      (per-sector TERRAIN/DEEP lines, user-dictated). Totals: plateau 12 · mountain 19 · minor_erg 5 ·
      desert 65 (deep 23) — match §2. No untyped areas remain.
- [x] Helpers in `src/engine/graph.ts` (neighbors / areAdjacent / isImpassable / airZonesOf /
      shortestGroundPath) + Vitest suite `board.test.ts` — **14 tests pass**: 101 areas, symmetric &
      connected graph, no isolated nodes, impassable disjoint from passable, air zones valid.
      Toolchain: Node 22, TypeScript (strict, `tsc --noEmit` clean), Vitest. (Vite+React deferred to Phase 3.)

### Phase 2 — Headless Harkonnen AI engine  *(the core value)*
Pure TS + tests, no UI. Model the round and the priority cascades from fan-summary p9:
- [x] **Spice Must Flow board** (`src/engine/spiceMustFlow.ts`, 13 tests): data captured from the
      physical SMF board (5 rows; per-row dice + harvester/ornithopter/carryall counts; bottom =
      Imperium Ban). `activeRow`/`availability`/`activeBans`; `resolveSpiceHarvesting` (solo
      allocation: keep lowermost first @2, raise surplus @3, all-top+7 → supremacy, reserve ≤1).
      Per-row dice availability [8,7,6,5,4] user-confirmed (top row = all 8, 1 set aside per row down).
- [x] Game-state types (`src/engine/state.ts`): legions (units/deploy tokens/leaders),
      settlements/sietches/testing-stations state, vehicles, wormsign/sandworm, tactical cards,
      Spice Must Flow + imperium bans, tracks, decks, action dice, round phases, `GameState`.
      Combat power (`combatPower.ts`: coarse + fine tie-break + diff) — 7 tests. (2026-06-27)
- [x] Round structure (`src/engine/round.ts`): phase sequence (`PHASE_ORDER`/`nextPhase`),
      8 tactical cards generated from board (one per sietch; 2 central = Hobars Gap + Windgap),
      start-of-round draw (harvesting sector + target sietch w/ re-draw constraints),
      mid-round target reselection, end-of-round supremacy/prescience constants. 12 tests. (2026-06-27)
- [~] Action-die resolver (`src/engine/harkonnenActions.ts`, 10 tests): LEADERSHIP/STRATEGY
      cascade — `selectSietchAttack` (reach incl. ornithopter "if necessary"; priority rank→CP
      diff→no-ornithopter→target sietch), `selectLegionAttack` (adjacent only, priority CP→named
      leader), `selectMove` (basic: nearest legion steps toward target), `resolveLeadershipOrStrategy`.
      Plus accessors (harkonnen/atreides legions, ornithopter zones, blocked-areas). MENTAT
      (`resolveMentat`), HOUSE (`resolveHouse`: replace 2 regulars→elites by legion priority, else
      place vehicles), DEPLOYMENT, and top-level `resolveAction` dispatch — all done. TODO: full
      movement tie-breakers + merge; "activate named-leader special first"; card-effect resolution.
- [x] **Movement** = shortest-path to target sietch + tie-breakers (the hard part).
      Primitives (`src/engine/movement.ts`, 15 tests): Harkonnen adjacency ignoring impassable
      borders, BFS distance/shortest-path with occupancy, `nearestByDistance`, ornithopter
      troop-transport. Policy (`selectMove`/`effectiveTarget`/`pickNextStep` in harkonnenActions.ts):
      target validation w/ temporary-target fallback (closest-to-target then highest rank), legion
      selection (nearest, CP tie-break, skip target-adjacent unless mergeable), 5 step tie-breakers
      (merge → closest-to-sietch → mountain → plateau/erg → desert w/o wormsign), merge rule. +4 tests.
- [x] **Combat** resolver (`src/engine/combat.ts`, 18 tests): `combatDiceCount` (units+discards
      +settlement rank, cap 6), `harkonnenShouldContinueAttack` (cease at ≤½ fine power; never
      retreat), `applyHarkonnenHits` (solo casualty priority: shed extra leaders→downgrade
      elite/sardaukar→remove regulars, keep last leader, named→regen), `applyDefaultHits` (defender),
      `resolveBattle` multi-round loop with injected `DiceProvider` (reinforcement discards to 6
      unless Landsraad ban, surprise +1, shields cancel hits, settlement continue-surcharge).
      **Leader-ability/special-elite resolution done** (`src/engine/combatRoll.ts`, 9 tests):
      `resolveCombatRoll` (generic leader special→1 hit, named→its combat strip, excess specials
      miss, opponent Sardaukar/Fedaykin cancel specials first) + `netHits` (shields cancel hits).
- [x] **Deployment** placement priority (`resolveDeployment` in harkonnenActions.ts, 4 tests):
      3 units + 1 leader (priority named Beast Rabban/Feyd-Rautha → any named → Bashar); settlement
      priority highest-CP legion → closest to target; unit substitution to next-higher tier;
      stacking-limit (6) overflow. Added `HarkonnenReserve` to GameState.
- [x] **Vehicle placement** (`src/engine/vehiclePlacement.ts`, 15 tests): `placeHarvesters`
      (4-tier priority + adjacency demotion + adjacent-sector overflow), `placeCarryalls` (zones
      protecting most harvesters), `placeOrnithopters` (threaten 2-away sietches → cover target
      sector → adjacent sectors central-first), `placeVehicles` orchestrator.
- [x] **Card data modules** (from `docs/images/` card photos): `leaders.ts` (7 named leaders +
      Bashar: action slot, entry condition, special, combat-ability hits/shields — all captured),
      `imperiumBans.ts` (3 bans; CHOAM→stacking 5 wired into deploy/move), `planningCards.ts`
      (36-card catalog: 18 House Harkonnen + 18 Corrino). Effect *resolution* deferred.
- [x] **Planning-card effect resolution** (`src/engine/cardEffects.ts`, 9 tests): every Harkonnen
      card (18 House Harkonnen + 18 Corrino Ally) encoded as ordered play STEPS. Auto-applies the
      deterministic ones (fixed-location unit placement, vehicle placement via the placement engine,
      deck draws); moves/attacks/leader-entries/choices render as player directives. `resolveCardPlay`
      + `applyCardSteps`; wired into the UI "Play a planning card" panel (auto/you badges). Shared
      `areaLabel` moved to `engine/describeArea.ts`.
- [x] **Named-leader special-action resolution** (`src/engine/leaderEffects.ts`, 5 tests): each
      named leader's red action (from `leaders.ts`) encoded as ordered steps via the shared
      `effectSteps.ts` machinery; auto-draws apply (Thufir 3, Gaius 2), moves/attacks/deploys/
      replacements stay player-resolved. `resolveLeaderSpecial`. The card + leader step builders were
      extracted to `effectSteps.ts` (shared by `cardEffects.ts` and `leaderEffects.ts`).
- [x] **Coriolis Storms** (`src/engine/storms.ts`, 11 tests): the 5 storm-exempt central plateaus
      are DERIVED from the board graph (plateaus encircled only by mountains/plateau = Arrakeen,
      Carthag, Imperial Basin, Hagga Basin, Arsunt — no board re-read needed). `isStormVulnerable`,
      per-special terrain hits (deep 2 / desert 1 / erg+plateau 0), `resolveCoriolisStorms` applies
      the standard Harkonnen casualty priority. UI: a "Coriolis Storms" Desert-Hazards panel where
      the player enters each exposed legion's 2-die result and the app applies the casualties.
- [x] **Tests against worked examples** (`src/engine/rulebookExamples.test.ts`, 4 tests): the
      rulebook combat-dice-count example (p24: 5 dice/side, 6 after a discard) and the leader-ability
      example (p25: Bashar special→1 hit, Baron→2 shields, Fedaykin cancels a special, Harkonnen
      score 3 hits). Noted the p25 example's printed "Atreides 3 Hits" nets to 2 by the written
      mechanics (a single rolled Harkonnen shield the text seems to drop).

### Phase 3 — React + TS UI
- [x] Project scaffold (Vite 6 + React 18 + TS; `npm run dev`/`build`/`preview`). `src/ui/`
      decoupled from the pure `src/engine/`. Build + dev server verified; 136 tests pass.
- [x] "Resolve Harkonnen turn" flow: `App.tsx` — this-round panel (dice/vehicles/bans from SMF),
      tap a die result → `resolveAction` → `describeAction` directive, then "Confirm & apply"
      mutates state via `applyHarkonnenAction` (`src/engine/applyAction.ts`, 8 tests: move/deploy/
      house/vehicles; attacks+mentat stay player-resolved). vehicle-placement panel. State persists.
- [x] Board-state editor (`src/ui/StateEditor.tsx`): state lifted into App; edit imperium markers
      (auto-derives bans), harvesting sector, target sietch, add/edit/remove legions (area, unit
      counts, generic/named leaders), sietch rank/revealed/destroyed + settlement destroyed toggles
      (destroying the target sietch clears the target), the Harkonnen reserve (off-board units/
      deploy-tokens/bashars/named leaders that deployment draws from), and add/remove wormsigns &
      sandworms (which the movement + vehicle-placement engine consume). Resolver + panels react live.
- [x] **New game preset** (`src/engine/newGame.ts`, 7 tests): `newGameState()` builds a fresh
      Mahdi-solo starting position (settlements/sietches/testing-stations derived from board.ts; 8
      Atreides legions = token + Naib per sietch; markers at top; 12 starting deployment tokens +
      start-in-play named leaders in the reserve pool; Harkonnen settlements empty per the solo
      pool rule). Wired to a "New game" button in the editor (undoable via `commit`).
- [ ] Sync the few Atreides-side changes the AI depends on

### Phase 4 — Persistence  *(✅ DONE 2026-06-27)*
- [x] Save/restore game state (`src/ui/persistence.ts`, 12 tests): single auto-saved game in
      localStorage (versioned key, shape-validated, storage-injectable) + Reset. Export/Import:
      `exportState` (versioned envelope) downloads a JSON file; `importState` (accepts the envelope
      or a bare GameState) loads it via a file picker. **Multiple named saves** (`SAVES_KEY` map:
      `listSaves`/`saveNamedGame`/`loadNamedGame`/`deleteNamedGame`, most-recent-first) with a
      "Saved games" panel in the editor (name + Save, per-row Load/Delete).

### Phase 5 — Polish & mobile
- [~] UX polish: **Undo** (header button, bounded 20-deep history) reverts the last applied
      Harkonnen action — resolve/card/leader/next-round apply through `commit` (snapshots first);
      import/named-load/reset start a fresh history via `loadGame`. TODO: more polish, then Capacitor.

### Phase 6 — Onboarding & teaching  *(future)*
Lower the barrier for a brand-new solo player picking up the app cold.
- [ ] **Guided board setup.** A step-by-step wizard that walks the player through physically
      laying out the board for a fresh Mahdi-solo game (place Atreides sietch legions, deployment
      tokens, named-leader/reserve pool, imperium markers, harvesting sector + target sietch draws),
      instead of dropping them at the StateEditor. Builds on `newGameState()` — narrate each piece
      as the app sets it, with the interactive board map showing where things go.
- [ ] **Teach solo mode.** In-app tutorial / first-run experience that explains how Mahdi solo
      works (you play Atreides; the app runs the Harkonnen AI; how a round flows: dice → actions →
      battles → spice → storms) so a player who's never run the solo rules can learn by playing.
      Could ride on the existing PhasePanel walkthrough + "How to use" help, expanded into a real
      onboarding flow.

## 4. Current status (update me each session)

- **✅ Phase 0 COMPLETE (2026-06-27).** All board data captured & user-verified in `BOARD_VERIFICATION.md`:
  areas/types/settlements/sietches/`deep` (§1), 101 areas + sectors + positional ids (§2/§2.1/§2.2),
  full adjacency graph (§3a, area-by-area verified), 11 impassable borders (§4), 8 air zones (§5).
  Visual map + graph well-formedness check in `BOARD_GRAPH.md` (`scripts/gen_map.py`/`gen_graph.py`).
- **✅ Phase 1 COMPLETE (2026-06-27).** Typed `board.ts` generated from `BOARD_VERIFICATION.md` via
  `scripts/gen_board.py`; all 101 areas terrain-typed; graph helpers + Vitest suite. Plus: 6 ecological
  testing stations added (`Area.testingStation`, §1 `STATIONS` line) — 16 tests pass.
- **Next action: Phase 2 — headless Harkonnen AI engine.** Start with game-state types (see Phase 2 list),
  built pure-TS + tests against fan-summary p9 (Mahdi solo). No UI yet.
