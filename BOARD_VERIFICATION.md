# Board verification checklist — please correct

**v2** — re-extracted from your physical-board photos (`docs/map/`), far more reliable
than the rulebook art. You correct it; then I generate the engine's `board.ts` from it.

**Confidence key:** ✅ confident · 🟡 likely · ❓ guess — please verify

**Board structure (confirmed):** two square sections joined at a central seam; polar map
with the **North Pole as the central hub**. Sectors radiate from the pole (4 central ring +
4 outer ring).

**Board orientation reference (confirmed — this is how the board is laid out & how we label it):**
The board sits in landscape, two square halves side by side. Our **N/E/S/W labels are
BOARD-relative (the physical edges), NOT in-world map directions** — the board is a polar
projection so in-world "north" is the North Pole at the **centre**, and every edge is really
"south" (away from the pole). Anchors for the board-relative compass:
- **West = left edge** → has the **Supremacy track**
- **East = right edge** → has the **Prescience track**
- **North = top edge** → beyond the Broken Land / Rimwall West mountain arc
- **South = bottom edge**
- **Centre = North Pole** (in-world north / the hub all air zones connect to)

**How to correct:** edit the tables directly. For adjacency, list area IDs sharing a **white
border**. Put **red/white impassable** pairs in §4 instead, not §3.

## 1. Areas

**TYPE = COLOUR (your rule):** dark-**orange** terrain → `plateau` · dark-**grey** terrain →
`mountain` · pale sandy/dune terrain → `desert` (`minor_erg` if it's the distinct erg texture).
I re-typed every area below by colour. 🟡 marks shadowed ridges where grey-vs-orange is hard to
judge from the photos — please eyeball these.

`deep`: Y if a desert touches the board edge · `feature`: settlement rank (I/II/III) or sietch

### Plateaus (dark orange) — incl. all the cities
| id | name | type | feature | conf |
|----|------|------|---------|------|
| arrakeen | Arrakeen | plateau | settlement III | ✅ |
| carthag | Carthag | plateau | settlement II | ✅ |
| arsunt | Arsunt | plateau | settlement I (Pyon village) | ✅ |

| false_wall_south | False Wall South | plateau | – | ✅ (your call) |
| pasty_mesa | Pasty Mesa | plateau | – | ✅ (your call) |

### Mountains (dark grey)

| splintered_rock | Splintered Rock | mountain | – | ✅ (your call) |
| false_wall_east | False Wall East | mountain | – | ✅ (your call) |

### Minor erg — 5 areas, contiguous chain starting at Harg Pass (only Harg Pass is named)
| id | name | type | feature | conf |
|----|------|------|---------|------|
| harg_pass | Harg Pass | minor_erg | – | ✅ (named) |
| minor_erg_2 | (unnamed minor erg) | minor_erg | – | ✅ (your call) |
| minor_erg_3 | (unnamed minor erg) | minor_erg | – | ✅ (your call) |
| minor_erg_4 | (unnamed minor erg) | minor_erg | – | ✅ (your call) |
| minor_erg_5 | (unnamed minor erg) | minor_erg | – | ✅ (your call) |

> The 4 unnamed minor ergs are adjacent to each other and to Harg Pass, forming one connected
> run (this is the large pale central region I had mislabeled `central_erg` — now resolved as
> these 5 minor ergs). I'll order erg_2→erg_5 along the chain once you confirm/refine §3 links.

### Desert (pale sand) — `deep`: only Sihaya Ridge, Rock Outcroppings, The Great Flat
| id | name | type | deep | feature | conf |
|----|------|------|------|---------|------|
| sihaya_ridge | Sihaya Ridge | desert | Y | sietch | ✅ |

| hobars_gap | Hobars Gap | desert | N | sietch | ✅ (name) |
| tasmin_sink | Tasmin Sink | desert | N | sietch | ✅ (name) |
| wind_pass | Wind Pass | desert | N | – | ✅ (s8; new — not a sietch) |

> **All 8 sietches named** ✅: Sihaya Ridge, Rock Outcroppings, Bight of the Cliff, Windgap,
> Habbanya Ridge, Gara Kulon, Hobars Gap, Tasmin Sink. (Still set `deep` Y/N per sietch.)
>
### Unnamed deep-desert areas (outer ring) — counting from user
All `type=desert`, `deep=Y`. **Counting convention:** the 4 **corner** areas are each one area
shared by two edges, so an edge's count *includes* its corners. Unique areas = corners + middles.

**Corners (4) — each shared by two edges**
| id | corner | shared by |
|----|--------|-----------|
| desert_nw | NW | North + West |
| desert_ne | NE | North + East |
| desert_sw | SW | West + South |
| desert_se | SE | South + East |

**Edge middles (non-corner)**
| id | edge | conf |
|----|------|------|
| desert_n2 | North | ✅ North=6 (= nw + ne + 4 middles) |
| desert_n3 | North | ✅ |
| desert_n4 | North | ✅ |
| desert_n5 | North | ✅ |
| desert_w2 | West | ✅ West=4 (= nw + sw + 2 middles) |
| desert_w3 | West | ✅ |
| desert_s1 | South | ✅ South=8 (= sw + se + 6 middles) |
| desert_s2 | South | ✅ |
| desert_s3 | South | ✅ |
| desert_s4 | South | ✅ |
| desert_s5 | South | ✅ |
| desert_s6 | South | ✅ |
| desert_e1 | East | ✅ East=6 (= ne + se + 4 middles) |
| desert_e2 | East | ✅ |
| desert_e3 | East | ✅ |
| desert_e4 | East | ✅ |

> **All four edges confirmed:** North=6 · West=4 · South=8 · East=6 (each includes its 2 corners).
> **Unique unnamed deep-desert areas = 20** (4 corners + 4 N + 2 W + 6 S + 4 E middles).
> Check: edge sum 6+4+8+6 = 24, minus 4 corners counted twice = 20. ✅
>
> These 20 unnamed areas + the named ones get assigned to sectors in §2 below.

## 2. Sectors (8 total: 4 central + 4 outer)

Each **area belongs to exactly one sector**. For each sector you give: **# areas** + the
**count per terrain type**. Direction labels are board-relative (see top note). We reconcile
against the grand totals as we go, then assign the actual member areas.

**Reliable pre-sector caps (confirmed by user):** minor_erg **5** (Harg Pass + 4) · deep-desert **23**
(20 unnamed per-edge + Sihaya Ridge, Rock Outcroppings, Great Flat). Both ✅ matched by the sector counts.

**NOT caps — only NAMED subsets** (sectors revealed many unnamed areas of these types too):
plateau named 8 · mountain named 7 · non-deep desert named 7. Real totals come from the sectors below.

| sector | c/o | #areas | plat | mtn | m.erg | deep des | desert |
|--------|-----|--------|------|-----|-------|----------|--------|
| sector | dir | #areas | plat | mtn | m.erg | deep des | desert |
| s1 | NE outer | 18 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 7 | 11 |
| s2 | SE outer | 10 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 4 |
| s3 | SW outer | 10 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 4 |
| s4 | NW outer | 20 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 6 | 10 |
| **outer Σ** | s1–s4 | **58** | **3** | **4** | **0** | **22** | **29** |
| s5 | NE inner | 16 | 4 | 9 | 2 | 0 | 1 |
| s6 | SE inner | 9 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 3 |
| s7 | SW inner | 8 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 |
| s8 | NW inner | 9 | 2 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| np | North Pole | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **TOTAL** | | **101** | **12** | **19** | **5** | **23** | **42** |

*(Sector ids: **s1 NE-outer → clockwise outer → s5 NE-inner → clockwise inner**. np = North Pole, shared by inner s5–s8.)*

*(Inner-sector counts **EXCLUDE North Pole** — it's 1 mountain area shared by all 4 central
sectors, counted once. It's added as its own row above.)*

**FINAL totals (all 8 sectors + North Pole):**
plateau **12** · mountain **19** · minor_erg **5** · deep-desert **23** · non-deep desert **42** = **101 areas**

> 🔴 **Major finding:** plateau & mountain have many **unnamed** areas too (named were only 8 & 7).
> Only minor_erg (5) and deep-desert (23) were real caps — both matched exactly ✅.
>
> **Named vs unnamed (101 total):** 26 named, **75 unnamed** —
> plateau 4 unnamed (12−8) · mountain 12 unnamed (19−7) · minor_erg 4 unnamed (Harg Pass chain) ·
> deep-desert 20 unnamed · non-deep desert 35 unnamed (42−7).
>
> ⚠️ **Sanity-check please:** 101 areas (19 mountain!) is large — worth a glance to confirm before we
> build the adjacency graph for all 101. Your minor_erg & deep-desert counts matched perfectly, so the
> method looks sound, but the mountain count especially is worth a second look.

> **Cross-check after all 4 outer sectors:**
> - ✅ **Plateau 3 outer / 5 left for central** — and the 5 remaining must be the **5 city plateaus**
>   (Arrakeen, Carthag, Arsunt, Hagga Basin, Imperial Basin) = the storm-safe "5 central plateaus". Clean!
> - ✅ **minor_erg 0 outer** — all 5 (Harg Pass chain) fall in central, as expected.
> - ✅ **mountain 4 outer / 3 left for central** (incl. North Pole the hub).
> - ✅ **deep-desert = 23 RESOLVED.** Was 22 after outer; the SE **inner** sector has 1 deep-desert
>   area (so not every central sector is 0 deep). 22 outer + 1 SE-inner = 23. No off-by-one after all.
> - **non-deep desert 29** (7 named + ~22 unnamed) — central will add a few more; we'll catalogue all
>   the unnamed non-deep areas in §1 after the 8 sectors are in.

> Rules note: Coriolis storms spare "the 5 **central plateau** areas." With the corrected types
> this is almost certainly the **5 city plateaus** (Arrakeen, Carthag, Arsunt, Hagga Basin,
> Imperial Basin) — please confirm.

## 2.1 Area roster — canonical IDs for all 101 areas

**ID scheme (user-chosen):** unnamed areas = **`s<sector>_<N>`**, numbered in **reading order**
(left→right, top→bottom) within the sector; **named areas keep their names** (used as landmarks).
**Terrain type is NOT in the id** — it's a separate attribute (annotated inline as `(deep)`,
`(mtn)`, etc. when discussing). `np` = North Pole.
*(The type-suffixed `s1_dd1`-style ids below are the OLD scheme — kept only as a per-type count
reference; the real positional `s#_N` ids get assigned as we trace each sector. §2.2 holds them.)*

## 4. Impassable borders (red/white lines)

```
s5_6  <-> shield_wall_1 # ✅ CONFIRMED (user): red impassable
s8_1  <-> s8_2          # ✅ CONFIRMED (user): red impassable
s8_1  <-> shield_wall_2 # ✅ CONFIRMED (user): red impassable = Shield Wall #2 west border
s4_15 <-> s4_16   # ✅ CONFIRMED (user): red line runs along the Shield Wall crest BETWEEN these two.
                  #   s4_16 is a MOUNTAIN area on the city side; it IS passable to arsunt/shield_wall_2/
                  #   broken_land. So the red arc is the s4_15|s4_16 seam here, NOT desert|mountain.
broken_land  <-> s4_11           # ✅ CONFIRMED (user): red impassable
broken_land  <-> s1_3            # ✅ CONFIRMED (user): red impassable
broken_land  <-> s1_4            # ✅ CONFIRMED (user): red impassable
rimwall_west <-> s1_4, s1_5      # ✅ CONFIRMED (user): red impassable (s1_4 also red to broken_land; s1_5 also red to s5_5)
s1_5 <-> s5_5                    # ✅ CONFIRMED (user): red impassable
s1_7 <-> s5_5                    # ✅ CONFIRMED (user): red impassable (the s1-facing mtn here is s5_5, not rimwall_west)
# REVISED MODEL: the red impassable arc is NOT simply "all mountain edges." It threads specific
# borders: s4_15|s4_16, and along the N face of Broken Land/Rimwall West facing the s1 desert.
# s4_16/shield_wall/broken_land are mutually passable on the city side. Re-derive full extent with
# the user while tracing s5/s8 (where Shield Wall #1 / Rimwall West / Broken Land live).

## 5. Air zones (≈8 blue circles with ornithopter icon) — many seen, pairings unconfirmed

Each air zone sits on a sector boundary and connects to all areas in both sectors (and the pole).
Seen at: between Hagga Basin / Imperial Basin · west of Shield Wall (×2) · around the pole (several) ·
east desert (×2–3) · SE. Please list each with the two sectors it straddles once §2 is set.

| air zone | sector A | sector B |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| az1      | ?        | ?        |
| ...      |          |          |
